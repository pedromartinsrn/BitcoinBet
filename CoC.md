This project embraces libertarian principles: individual liberty, non-aggression, voluntary association, and respect for property rights (including intellectual contributions to the project). We aim to foster an open environment where ideas can be freely exchanged without unnecessary restrictions.

Core Principles:

- **Full Freedom of Expression**: You are free to express any ideas, opinions, criticisms, or humor, as long as it does not violate laws (e.g., no credible threats of violence, fraud, or direct incitement to illegal actions). We do not censor based on viewpoint, offense, or political correctness.

- **Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)**: Do not initiate force, coercion, or aggression against others. This includes doxxing, targeted harassment, spam, or malicious disruption of the project (e.g., flooding issues/PRs).

- **Voluntary Participation**: All involvement is voluntary. If you disagree with the project, community, or decisions, you are free to fork, leave, or create alternatives. No one is obligated to participate or accept contributions.

- **Respect for Property**: Respect the project's code, guidelines, and maintainers' decisions. Contributions are welcome but subject to approval; maintainers have final say.

Scope:

This applies to all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, and related communications.

Reporting and Enforcement:

If you believe someone has violated the NAP (e.g., aggression or spam), report it to the maintainers at nitidev@proton.me. We review reports on a case-by-case basis and aim for minimal interventionâ€”preferring dialogue over bans. Repeated or severe violations may result in warnings, temporary restrictions, or permanent bans from participation.

Maintainers' decisions are final, but we encourage open discussion. This CoC can be amended via community consensus.

By participating, you agree to these principles. Let's build a free and innovative prediction market together!
